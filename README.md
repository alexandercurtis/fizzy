# Fizzy Text

A Java Applet to add bubbles to an image. Originally this ran in a web browser, but modern browsers make it difficult to run applets, so the best way to run it is to use `appletviewer` which comes with the Java Development Kit.

## To build
You will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

    javac Fizzy.java

## To run

    appletviewer Fizzy.html
